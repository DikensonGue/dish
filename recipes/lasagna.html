    This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Homemade Lasagna Ingredients</h3>
    These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:


</p>
<p><strong>· Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</p>
<p><strong>· Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</p>
<p><strong>· Canned tomatoes;</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>· Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</p>
<P><strong>· Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>· Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</p>
<strong>· Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</p>
<p><strong>· Cheese: </strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</p>
<p><strong>· Eggs:</strong> nEggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
